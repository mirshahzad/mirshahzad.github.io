Goals/Deliverables:
- Nowadays, fast and reliable communication without breaking continuity between the IoT devices is a big challenge, because there are many cryptographic algorithms have been invented. So, it is difficult to determine which one is better and compatible with the concerned device and useful for communication purposes.
- We tried in this research paper to fill this gap by making a comparative analysis of frequently used cryptographic algorithms.
- The authors compared 23 frequently used algorithms with properties of key size, message size, and execution time.
- This result and comparison is useful for organizations to apply the cryptographic algorithms in the technology for security purposes in the context of communication.
