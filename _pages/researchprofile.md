I've worked on two collaborative research projects one of them was with Prof. Mauro Conti and Prof. Gulshan. The main objective of that research was to research AI in DLT to develop an EHR application based on Hyperledger Fabric Technology. However, I equip myself with the basic background knowledge in that research. The second collaborative project was with Prof. Tauseef which was the extension of my master's thesis, in which we compared 23 frequently used cryptographic algorithms such as ElGamal, RSA, DH, Schnorr, DSA, and others. My first author paper was published on the same research. Furthermore, I presented my master's thesis work at the Arab Security Conference which is the biggest conference in the MENA region. Additionally, I'm reviewing research manuscripts for 02 journals (The International Journal of Communication Systems and The Computer Journal by Oxford Academic) and 01 conference (Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences).

COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECTS:
---
1. **Application of AI in Distributed Ledger Technology** \
May 2021 - Sep 2022 \
**Collaborative Researchers:** Shahzad A., Prof. Mauro Conti and Prof. Gulshan Kumar \
**Goals/Deliverables:**\
- A Review of the Electronic Health Records System
- Emerging of the AI with DLT Technology
- Creating an AI-DLT model to secure the EHR System
- Develop an EHR app by using Hyperledger Fabric Technology

2. **Comparative Analysis of Cryptographic Algorithms in Context of Communication: A Systematic Review** \
Dec 2020 â€“ Jul 2022 \
**Collaborative Researchers:** Shahzad A. and Prof. Tauseef Ahmed \
**Goals/Deliverables:**\
- Nowadays, fast and reliable communication without breaking continuity between the IoT devices is a big challenge, because there are many cryptographic algorithms have been invented. So, it is difficult to determine which one is better and compatible with the concerned device and useful for communication purposes.
- We tried in this research paper to fill this gap by making a comparative analysis of frequently used cryptographic algorithms.
- The authors compared 23 frequently used algorithms with properties of key size, message size, and execution time.
- This result and comparison is useful for organizations to apply the cryptographic algorithms in the technology for security purposes in the context of communication.
