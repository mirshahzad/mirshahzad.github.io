I am also working with a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant (UK based) as a Risk Analyst on a remote basis since July 2023.

Furthermore, I am working as a freelancer on Upwork (Iâ€™m Top Rated on Upwork) and Fiverr (Level-1), and also served as a cybersecurity specialist and researcher for Temple Logiq, a US-based startup company from 2022 to 2023.
