**About me**
I am an information security specialist with over four years of diverse experience in both industry and academia, working on multiple projects with different clients. 

I hold a master’s degree in information security from ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russia (through a competitive subject-based Russian Government Scholarship). I have published my “Comparative Analysis of Cryptographic Algorithms in the Context of Communication” research paper in an international journal. I have contributed to two significant collaborative research projects: one with renowned Prof. Mauro Conti focusing on AI-DLT-based healthcare applications, and another with Prof. Tauseef Ahmed, resulting in a first-author publication. I have presented my master’s thesis at the MENA region’s largest Arab Security Conference and am currently peer-reviewing for two journals and one conference. 

In industry, I am a freelancer on Upwork (I’m Top-Rated on Upwork) and Fiverr (Level-1), and doing different types of cybersecurity projects with different clients, including but not limited to cryptography, privacy, forensics, risk analysis and management, security compliance, cybersecurity roadmap, and so forth. I am also working as a Risk Analyst with a UK-based Senior Cybersecurity Consultant, ensuring the security of one of the renowned Scottish Courts (on remote basis). Additionally, I worked as an Incharge of the Data Source Unit at the National Assembly of Pakistan from 2022-2024, where I led projects, such as; data management, innovation, data security, data analysis, security operations, and mentored junior staff. Furthermore, I worked as a Cybersecurity Specialist and Researcher for the US-based start-up Temple Logiq, where I created a comprehensive security roadmap and conducted other confidential projects.
